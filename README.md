# Museum AI Chatbot (Heritage Guide)

A production-grade, multilingual AI chatbot designed for Indian museums. It handles ticket bookings, provides museum information (hours, parking, cafe), and supports context-aware conversations in multiple Indian languages and scripts.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English and 9+ Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi).
- **Dual Script Recognition**: Detects and responds in both Native scripts (e.g., नमस्ते) and Romanized/Latin scripts (e.g., Namaste).
- **AI-Powered & Resilient**: Integrated with Google Gemini AI for natural conversations, with a robust rule-based fallback system for offline usage or quota limits.
- **Secure Ticketing**: In-chat ticket booking workflow with SQLite backend and unique ticket ID generation.
- **Authentication**: Secure login via Google OAuth or standard username/password with OTP verification.
- **Deployment Ready**: Fully containerized with Docker, Nginx (Reverse Proxy), and Gunicorn.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1.  **User Arrival**: User lands on the home page and is prompted to log in.
2.  **Authentication**: User authenticates via Google or manual registration. If manual, an OTP is sent (or logged in console in dev mode).
3.  **Chat Interaction**: 
    - The `chatbot_engine` detects the user's language and script.
    - AI (Gemini) generates a response based on strict system instructions.
    - If AI fails/is unavailable, the "Backup Brain" (Rule-based) takes over.
4.  **Booking Flow**:
    - User asks for tickets.
    - Bot presents exhibition options from the database.
    - User selects an exhibition and quantity.
    - Bot generates a "Proceed to Payment" button.
    - On success, a booking record is created and a unique hash is displayed.
